				<h1>Solunis</h1>

			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_UI.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>Solunis was developed by a team of four people over 48 hours using Photoshop and Unity to create our game. We split the work up by sections. Two people worked on the art and two people worked on creating the code that would make the game operate. I was tasked with one other to work on the code for the project. I worked on creating the basic movement for the player and enemies as well as the combat system involing attacks, damage, healing, and the UI. Aside from those tasks, I was also in charge of implimenting the art and animations into unity to work with the movement and attacks of the various characters.</p>

			<p>I also worked on the point buy system pictured above for this project. This was my greatest challenge as I hadn't previosuly worked on something like this. I was able to learn to use singleton patterns to store the information and keep the data through numrous scenes and scripts. Using this now I was able to imporove my past and future projects by utilizing this same pattern. </p>

			<p>Kitty Hop was developed for the Global Gam Jam 2022 by a small team of three. The game was developed with the theme of duality in mind. The game involves jumping on enough kittens to get the golden carrot to appear. The player must collect the carrot to win the level. As the player jumps on kittens rage build up that causes the world to switch to a darker mirrored world where the kittens are faster and the player can now throw projectiles at the kittens. This dark reflection of the world help was inspired by the theme of duality for the game jam</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyHop_Switch.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I worked on programming Kitty Hop. I worked on the basic platformer movement with both the player and the enemies. I also did work on the combat system for the players and enemies linking their animation to the actions they could take in the game. I also worked on the portals for levels 2 and 3 which could teleport the player between the two point when they collided with the portals hitbox. The main coding challenge for this project was developing the switch between the two worlds. I accomplished this by creating two spirtes for each object and toggling them on and off based on the number of kittens killed which scales to the lower bar on the player's UI.</p>

					<p>I have always thought steam punk was a really unique and interesting style. I had been develpoing my skills in Maya and wanted to create a high quality asset pack that I could use for any future games that I may create. The whole modeling, texturing, and rendering process took a few days in total.</p>

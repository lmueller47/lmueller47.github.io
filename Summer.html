				<h1>Solunis</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_UI.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>Solunis was developed by a team of four people over 48 hours using Photoshop and Unity to create our game. We split the work up by sections. Two people worked on the art and two people worked on creating the code that would make the game operate. I was tasked with one other to work on the code for the project. I worked on creating the basic movement for the player and enemies as well as the combat system involing attacks, damage, healing, and the UI. Aside from those tasks, I was also in charge of implimenting the art and animations into unity to work with the movement and attacks of the various characters.</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_PointBuy.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I also worked on the point buy system pictured above for this project. This was my greatest challenge as I hadn't previosuly worked on something like this. I was able to learn to use singleton patterns to store the information and keep the data through numrous scenes and scripts. Using this now I was able to imporove my past and future projects by utilizing this same pattern. </p>

			<header class="Kitty Hop">

			<p>Kitty Hop was developed for the Global Gam Jam 2022 by a small team of three. The game was developed with the theme of duality in mind. The game involves jumping on enough kittens to get the golden carrot to appear. The player must collect the carrot to win the level. As the player jumps on kittens rage build up that causes the world to switch to a darker mirrored world where the kittens are faster and the player can now throw projectiles at the kittens. This dark reflection of the world help was inspired by the theme of duality for the game jam</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyHop_Switch.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I worked on programming Kitty Hop. I worked on the basic platformer movement with both the player and the enemies. I also did work on the combat system for the players and enemies linking their animation to the actions they could take in the game. I also worked on the portals for levels 2 and 3 which could teleport the player between the two point when they collided with the portals hitbox. The main coding challenge for this project was developing the switch between the two worlds. I accomplished this by creating two spirtes for each object and toggling them on and off based on the number of kittens killed which scales to the lower bar on the player's UI.</p>

				<h1>UWW Summer Game Development Camp 2023</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Game_Camp_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>For two weeks in the summer of 2023 I worked with Professor Nick Hwang and another student, Brian Michael, to help guide both middle and high school students through the typical game design process. I worked as the art lead for the course helping students work with Photoshop and Piskel to create their own art and animations for their games. I worked to help instill principles of art and animation techniques while also trying to get the kids to be able to communicate effectively when talking about the technical aspects of art and game design. I also spent a decent portion of the time helping with the custom scripting that was needed for numerous games. I worked on automatic targeting for tower defense games, multiple controller input controls, and several others features that would help provide a basis for the students to utilize.</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Game_Camp_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>The camp was a great experience for me to develop and hone the necessary skills for the game industry. While teaching at the camp I was able to understand the vitality of communication in the game industry, as being able to communicate in effective terms was important to keeping everything clear to all people involved in the projects. I was also able to experience a much wider array of problems then I had been ale to before. With so many different games being develped there was so much new things that I had to find new and ineresting solutions to.</p>

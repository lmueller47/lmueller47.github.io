				<h1>Solunis</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_UI.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>Solunis was developed by a team of four people over 48 hours using Photoshop and Unity to create our game. We split the work up by sections. Two people worked on the art and two people worked on creating the code that would make the game operate. I was tasked with one other to work on the code for the project. I worked on creating the basic movement for the player and enemies as well as the combat system involing attacks, damage, healing, and the UI. Aside from those tasks, I was also in charge of implimenting the art and animations into unity to work with the movement and attacks of the various characters.</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_PointBuy.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I also worked on the point buy system pictured above for this project. This was my greatest challenge as I hadn't previosuly worked on something like this. I was able to learn to use singleton patterns to store the information and keep the data through numrous scenes and scripts. Using this now I was able to imporove my past and future projects by utilizing this same pattern. </p>

			<header class="Kitty Hop">
				<h1>Kitty Hop</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyHop_Gameplay.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>Kitty Hop was developed for the Global Gam Jam 2022 by a small team of three. The game was developed with the theme of duality in mind. The game involves jumping on enough kittens to get the golden carrot to appear. The player must collect the carrot to win the level. As the player jumps on kittens rage build up that causes the world to switch to a darker mirrored world where the kittens are faster and the player can now throw projectiles at the kittens. This dark reflection of the world help was inspired by the theme of duality for the game jam</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyHop_Switch.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I worked on programming Kitty Hop. I worked on the basic platformer movement with both the player and the enemies. I also did work on the combat system for the players and enemies linking their animation to the actions they could take in the game. I also worked on the portals for levels 2 and 3 which could teleport the player between the two point when they collided with the portals hitbox. The main coding challenge for this project was developing the switch between the two worlds. I accomplished this by creating two spirtes for each object and toggling them on and off based on the number of kittens killed which scales to the lower bar on the player's UI.</p>

					<div class="image main"><img src="images/Pirates_Lvl1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
					<p>Pirate Time was developed as a class project for UW-Whitewater starting in mid November of 2022. I worked on it with one other classmate, we separated the work with one person handling the coding of the project and one person worked on art. I took on the art aspect of this project. All of the art for this project is original and was done in the month period we had for the final. I was in charge of the art as well as the animations for all player characters and enemies. I used Unity's built in skeletal animation tool to create the animations for all the characters in the game. All the art of the game is original and sketched out in Photoshop.</p>

					<div class="image main"><img src="images/Pirates_Character_Select.jpg" alt="" /></div>
					<p>Along with all of the visual aspects of the project I also handled some of the coding elements as well. I created all of the game and scene managers that would use the singleton pattern to exist through different scenes including the Audio Manager, Player Manager, and Game Manager. I also created the menu scenes as well as the player select screen as shown above. The character select screen works by using the player manager to record which character the player selects then spawns the selected player in at the beginning of each playable scene.</p>
					<p>Below is just a few of the character assets that I developed for the game.</p>

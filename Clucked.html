						<h1>Cluck'd</h1>

					<p>Cluck'd was a capstone project developed for the UW-Whitewater Media Arts and Game Development course. I had the opprotunity to head up the marketing department which consisted of a small team of four. I worked to develop a marketing plan and strategy, a systems to meausre our marketing impact, as well as other various programming and art tasks that the programming and art team were falling behind on. Due to a non-existent budget we relied heavily on social media marketing through Youtube, Tiktok, and Instagram. After roughly 2 months of marketing we were able to see a great deal of success on Youtube. With just 9 posts (1 trailer and 8 shorts) we were able to amass over 50K views and almost 400 hours of watch time.</p>
					<p>One of the main challenges when developing this project was working around not having a budget. Our solution to this was to focus heavily on social media marketing as that is the easiest and cheapest way to reach our target audience of 17-24 year olds. Another challenge was working around the schedules of all people on the team. Scheduling meetings and dividing work to my team members was quite difficult, but I managed to schedule everything by having my team members provide me with their indivdual schedules so I could set up meetings where everyone could attend. I found this solution to be a whole lot easier than asking each individual when they were free.</p>

						<h1>Cluck'd Teaser Trailer</h1>

					<p>I tasked myself with developing a teaser trailer for the game. The trailer was developed in Blender where I handled modeling, rigging, texturing, and animation of the scene and main character. It was rendered in Blender and then ported to After Effects where audio and some effects were added to polish the trailer. After rendering the new effects the trailer was uploaded to Youtube.</p>
					<p>This was my first endeavor into complex texturing with Blender. Although there was a learning curve, I am quite happy with the final results of the rusting walls and floor texture. I only had about a week and a half to complete this trailer so learning texturing as well as managing my time effectively to finish the project was a big challenge that I was able to overcome.</p>

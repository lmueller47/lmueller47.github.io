			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_UI.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>Solunis was developed by a team of four people over 48 hours using Photoshop and Unity to create our game. We split the work up by sections. Two people worked on the art and two people worked on creating the code that would make the game operate. I was tasked with one other to work on the code for the project. I worked on creating the basic movement for the player and enemies as well as the combat system involing attacks, damage, healing, and the UI. Aside from those tasks, I was also in charge of implimenting the art and animations into unity to work with the movement and attacks of the various characters.</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solunis_PointBuy.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I also worked on the point buy system pictured above for this project. This was my greatest challenge as I hadn't previosuly worked on something like this. I was able to learn to use singleton patterns to store the information and keep the data through numrous scenes and scripts. Using this now I was able to imporove my past and future projects by utilizing this same pattern. </p>

			<p>Kitty Hop was developed for the Global Gam Jam 2022 by a small team of three. The game was developed with the theme of duality in mind. The game involves jumping on enough kittens to get the golden carrot to appear. The player must collect the carrot to win the level. As the player jumps on kittens rage build up that causes the world to switch to a darker mirrored world where the kittens are faster and the player can now throw projectiles at the kittens. This dark reflection of the world help was inspired by the theme of duality for the game jam</p>
			<div class="image main"><img src="images/KittyHop_Switch.jpg" alt="" /></div>
			<p>I worked on programming Kitty Hop. I worked on the basic platformer movement with both the player and the enemies. I also did work on the combat system for the players and enemies linking their animation to the actions they could take in the game. I also worked on the portals for levels 2 and 3 which could teleport the player between the two point when they collided with the portals hitbox. The main coding challenge for this project was developing the switch between the two worlds. I accomplished this by creating two spirtes for each object and toggling them on and off based on the number of kittens killed which scales to the lower bar on the player's UI.</p>

					<p>Interactable NFT's was a project developed by myself and professor Nick Hwang for UW-Whitewater's Research Apprenticeship Program. We wanted to make a way for multiple people to interact through the web to edit the same canvas. We decided on using P5.js and its uses with generative NFT's as our canvas of choice. I programmed on P5.js to create the framework of what the users can edit. They can choose between three preset images or upload their own photos. The sketch in P5.js then takes the image information and pixelates those images then continuously edits the pixels by creating curves and updates them based on a random function and a slider that is controled by the external website. The website also contains the means to start and stop the sketch creating a still image like the one pictured above. To stop too many users from overloading the system we created a timer so that a button would be frozen for all other users when one user is interacting with a button.</p>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/RAP_NFT_Interface.jpg" alt="" /></div>
					<p>Although it is not currently an NFT it can be made into one wth a purchase. However, we didn't want to publish it until we were ready to finish the project. We plan to continue the project further by including in interactive art board in VR for the project to replace the input images. The possibilities are endless for the features we can add to the website for the user to interact with and we plan to explore more with these generative and highly interactable NFT's.</p>

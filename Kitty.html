			<p>Kitty Hop was developed for the Global Gam Jam 2022 by a small team of three. The game was developed with the theme of duality in mind. The game involves jumping on enough kittens to get the golden carrot to appear. The player must collect the carrot to win the level. As the player jumps on kittens rage build up that causes the world to switch to a darker mirrored world where the kittens are faster and the player can now throw projectiles at the kittens. This dark reflection of the world help was inspired by the theme of duality for the game jam</p>

			<p>I worked as the lead on the programming team for Kitty Hop. I worked on the basic platformer movement with both the player and the enemies. I also did work on the combat system for the players and enemies linking their animation to the actions they could take in the game. I also worked on the portals for levels 2 and 3 which could teleport the player between the two point when they collided with the portals hitbox. The main coding challenge for this project was developing the switch between the two worlds. I accomplished this by creating two spirtes for each object and toggling them on and off based on the number of kittens killed which scales to the lower bar on the player's UI.</p>
